9th International Semantic Sensor Networks Workshop (SSN 2018)

We would like to invite you cordially to consider contributing a paper to SSN 2018 - held as a part of the 17th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2018).
 
Rapid growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) means that connected sensors and actuators will be inundating the Web infrastructure with data. Semantics is increasingly seen as a key enabler for integration of sensor data and the broader Web ecosystem. The W3C and the Open Geospatial Consortium standardisation bodies have taken a second look at the Semantic Sensor Network ontology and have published a new standard ontology for representing Sensors, Observations, Sampling, Actuation and Sensor Networks. Analytical and reasoning capabilities afforded by Semantic Web standards and technologies are considered important for developing advanced applications that go from capturing observations to recognition of events, deeper insights and actions. Furthermore, the contribution of semantics to sensing and actuation patterns is currently being explored. Major industries including manufacturing, transport and logistics, personal and public health, smart cities and smart energy, crisis management and many others are spanning commercial, civic, and scientific operations that involve sensors, web, services and semantics. This workshop will continue the activity started within ISWC in 2006, and complemented by special tracks at ESWC since 2010. This 2018 edition benefits from renewed energy arising from the October 2017 W3C recommendation and OGC standard and, more importantly, increases significance due to the growth of IoT-enabled applications.
 
The SSN workshop will be a half-day event that revives and strengthens the community around the ontological representation of sensor and actuation data and welcomes researchers from related communities. It will be highly interactive, so as to facilitate discussions among participants that could result in future collaborative work. An invited talk will be followed by authors presenting research papers in either long or short format, together with demonstrations that have been a successful feature of SSN in the past. Sufficient time will be dedicated to questions and answers for each paper. The session will end with a general discussion on experience with relevant ontologies and ideas for next steps.
